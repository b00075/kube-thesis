# Liberty getting started application
This app expands on The Getting Started tutorial for Liberty which uses a sample application to provide you with a sample workflow for working with any Liberty app on IBM Cloud; you set up a development environment, deploy an app locally and on the cloud, and then integrate an IBM Cloud database service in your app. 

The app uses the [Cloudant Java Client](https://github.com/cloudant/java-cloudant) to add information to a database and then return information from a database to the UI.

The user enters the name, Mary and the screen refreshes to display, Hello, Mary, I've added you to the database. The database contents listed are now Mary, Joe, Jane, and Bob.">
